        <h1>Advice From Sophia</h1>
        <div class="adviceSection">
          <span>My advice to girls interested in computer science or engineering is to explore what jobs are out there! I had no idea that design and coding had a big connection with one another! This helped me spark interest into the creative, yet technical field of coding. I noticed how there is game design, UX/UI design, AI engineering, and so much more! Try not to limit yourself into thinking its just a math major when exploring the STEM fields. </span>

      <h1>Sophia Paz</h1>
      <p> I am a senior who is passionate about web design and creative coding! I am from Santa Clarita and saw how the gender gap in my district was affecting the young girls at my school. Many girls at my high school saw computer science as a boring and male-dominated class. I wanted to expose the gender gap and hopefully bring interests into the STEM field. I collaborated with Jasmine to help create this informative, yet visual-appealing website for girls in Santa Clarita and beyond. </p>

        <div class="adviceSection">
          <span>Don't feel that you don't have the abilities to pursue STEM. You are amazing, and you definitely have the abilities to succeed. Don't let a man or anyone tell you otherwise. While the field is male-dominated, just know that there are many great communities of women in STEM. Also, there is no need to be perfect all the time. It is okay to make mistakes. That is part of the learning process. You got this and stay empowered!</span>

      <p>I am a senior from Santa Clarita, California who loves code, design, and research. I am passionate about web development and human-computer interaction. I created (G)-STEM with Sophia to address the gender gap that continues to exist today, targeting what is preventing women from entering the field. I want to empower women to join the field and inspire girls in my community and other marginalized communities in their abilities to pursue STEM.</p>

<h1 class="toastHeader">TRANSPARENCY:</h1><h1 class="toast">Why is there still a gender gap? What is preventing women, women of color, from joining the STEM fields, specifically in engineering and computer science? </h1>

<h1 class="toastHeader">ANALYSIS:</h1><h1 class="toast">We saw many websites showing only the numbers of the gender gap in STEM. They only display the difference in numbers between men and women in the field. That's it.</h1>
  
<h1 class="toastHeader">STRATEGY:</h1><h1 class="toast">Instead of just showing the numbers, we wanted to research and survey communities of young women of color to find out what is deterring them from STEM.</h1>
  
<h1 class="toastHeader">TRANSFORMATION:</h1><h1 class="toast">We want to reach many communities of young women of color and make the reasons clear to why the gender gap is a major problem and why it still exists today.</h1>
