      <div class="allFindingsParagraphs">
        <p class=problemDescription>The STEM field, specifically in computer science and engineering, continues to be male-dominated. There is all this talk about closing the gender gap, but it still exists to this day. The number of women employed in computing jobs today is lower than it was 27 years ago. Women in engineering jobs are barely increasing with only a 1.4% increase from 2015 to 2020. This is an issue.</p>
