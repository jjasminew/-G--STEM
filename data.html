  <div class ="allFindingsParagraphs">
  <p class = problemDescription>The STEM field, specifically in computer science and engineering, continues to be male-dominated. There is all this talk about closing the gender gap in STEM, but it still exists to this day. The number of women employed in computing jobs has even dropped from 32% in 1995 to 26.2% in 2021. Women in engineering jobs are barely increasing with only a 1.4% increase from 2015 to 2020. This is an issue. Instead of just revealing the numbers, we are targeting what is preventing women from joining these STEM fields.</p>
